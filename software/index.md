## Software

### Primary developer
I like writing software, and if I can and it makes sense, I open source it. This page is a list of the software projects that I have started.

- [csvtools](/software/csvtools/): gnu-tools alike csv utilities, supporting nested separators and newlines, at high performance.
- [TCP forwarding: a language battle](/software/tcp-forwarding-a-language-battle/): tcp multiplexing port forwarder implemented in different languages: c, rust, go, nodejs.
- [ported hashfunctions](/software/hash_functions/): I have ported several hash functions to other languages than they were originally defined in, these are non-cryptographic, high performance hash functions useful for hash tables.
- [Entity Framework Wrappable Fields Extensions](/software/efqueries/):
