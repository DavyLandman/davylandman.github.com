## Welcome

Hello my name is Davy Landman. I'm a [software engineer](#software), [researcher<sup>(in training)</sup>](#research), [blogger](/blog/), [tweeter](https://www.twitter.com/DavyLandman), [woodworker](http://pinterest.com), [photographer](https://www.flickr.com/DavyLandman), [gardener](http://?). The list is continuously growing as I'm the victim of broad interest and the leisure of free time (be it ever limited).

On this site I share my professional interests and achievements, you'll find pre-prints and abstracts of my published [papers](#research), a list of [software](#software) I have developed or contributed too, and a [blog](/blog/) about stuff that I'd like to share, but won't fit in a tweet.

### Software

Writing software is a wonderful combination of creativity and engineering. Here is a list of the open source project's developed or frequently contribute to.

- [Rascal MPL](http://www.rascal-mpl.org/): the one-stop-shop for metaprogramming. Since 2011 I've been part of the main contributors of this programming language. Contributions in Unicode compatibility, cross-platform stability, overall performance, IDE experience, and general all around bug fixing.
- [csvtools](https://www.github.com/davylandman/csvtools/): a collection of gnu like command line utilities for manipulation and filtering CSV files accurately<sup>(newlines and separators in quoted fields)</sup> and efficiently<sup>(400MB/s)</sup>. This is one of my PhD pet projects, I had large CSVs with quoted fields, the options were either R or very ugly regular expression.
- [pdb.values](https://www.github.com/cwi-swat/pdb.values/): the program database used as primary data structure for Rascal MPL. Primary contributions in Unicode correct string operations, source location data structure, optimizing memory/speed, binary file format improvements.
- [cloud-backup](): small utility to sync a directory with pictures to another folder, but it also compresses and rescales the pictures in the target folder to 300dpi at 10x15cm print size. This reduces the size of the files greatly and allows you to keep this folder in dropbox/google drive without consuming too much space. 
- [EFWrappableFields](): allow enum and protected collections in C# Entity Framework classes without impacting LINQ. This is a library I open source while working at a previous employer, it enabled C# features not supported by the EF team, while keeping the same SQL queries. It involved some rewriting of the LINQ expression tree.
