## Welcome

Hello my name is Davy Landman. I'm a [software engineer](#software), [researcher<sup>(in training)</sup>](#research), [blogger](/blog/), [tweeter](https://www.twitter.com/DavyLandman), [woodworker](http://pinterest.com), [photographer](https://www.flickr.com/DavyLandman), [gardener](http://?). This list is continuously growing as I have broad interest only limited by time available.

On this site I share my professional interests and achievements, you'll find pre-prints and abstracts of my published [papers](#research), a list of [software](#software) I have developed or contributed too, and a [blog](/blog/) about stuff that interests me, but don't fit in a tweet.
