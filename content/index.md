Davy Landman

Hi, I am the Co-Founder and CEO of SWAT.engineering, an enthusiastic Software Engineer, and have a PhD in Software Engineering research. Next to this I enjoy woodworking, 3d-printing, and cooking. 

I started out as an enterprise software engineer, then went to further study with prof.dr. Paul Klint and prof.dr. Jurgen Vinju to learn about a better way to develop software. After finishing my PhD, we started SWAT.engineering to bring Domain Specific Languages to the enterprise software world.

I contribute to open source when luxury permits, and am one of the core-developers of the Rascal meta programming language. I am interested in a wide range of challenges: domain & language design, reverse engineering, concurrency, encryption, compression, Unicode, performance, and many more.  

You can also find me on twitter, linkedin, and StackOverflow.
