Hi, I am the Co-Founder and CEO of [SWAT.engineering](http://www.swat.engineering), a proud father, an enthusiastic Software Engineer, and have a [PhD](/research/) in Software Engineering research. Next to this I enjoy woodworking, 3d-printing, gardening, and cooking. 

I started out as an enterprise software engineer, then went to further study with [prof.dr. Paul Klint](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~paulk/) and [prof.dr. Jurgen Vinju](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~jurgenv/) to learn about a better way to develop software. After finishing my PhD, we started SWAT.engineering to bring Domain Specific Languages to the enterprise software world.

I contribute to [open source <i class="fab fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/DavyLandman) when luxury permits, and am one of the core-developers of the [Rascal meta programming language](http://www.rascal-mpl.org/). I am interested in a wide range of challenges: domain & language design, reverse engineering, concurrency, encryption, compression, Unicode, performance, and many more.  

You can also find me on [<i class="fab fa-twitter"></i>](https://twitter.com/DavyLandman), [<i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davylandman/), [<i class="fab fa-stack-overflow"></i>](https://stackoverflow.com/users/11098/davy-landman), or send me an email: [<i class="fas fa-envelope-open"></i>](mailto:davy.landman@gmail.com).
